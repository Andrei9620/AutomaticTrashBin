# AutomaticTrashBin
This project involved building an automatic trash bin using an Arduino Uno, two servo motors, an ultrasonic sensor, and an infrared sensor. The system detects the presence of a hand or object near the bin using the sensors and automatically opens the lid via the servo motors, providing a touchless and hygienic waste disposal solution.
